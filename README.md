## Description
* Simple casual type games with a casino atmosphere
* 100% programmatic UI
* Custom levels, leaderboard, daily bonuses, avatars, stats, game history


### Frameworks
* UIKit
* StoreKit
* GameKit
* CoreData
* Firebase

## Lessons Learned
* In App Purchases with Store Kit, the pains and the gains
* Leaderboard integration with GameKit is pretty simple
* Spend more time mocking/scoping instead of winging it 🙄

* Repository currently private for keys and what not :)  I may open source soon.
